# STEVE JOBS: Stanford Commencement

  **I'm hornerd** to be with you today **for your commencement** from one of the finest universites in this world. **Truth be told**, I never graduated from college. This is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. **No big deal**, just three stories.
  
  The first story is about **connecting the dots**.
  
  I **dropped out of Reed College** after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born.
  
  My biological mother was a young, umwed graduate student, and she decided to **put me up for adoption**. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything is all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.Æ’
